<p><strong><a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org">Mendicant University</a> exists to support programmers in developing both their technical skills and their social contributions so that they can make a real positive impact upon the world.</strong></p>
<p>Rather than having a particular fixed set of goals and ideologies, we prefer to be defined by what our community does. This website is designed to give our students and staff a place to share the things they&#39;ve been working on as well as links to other works that they find interesting.</p>
<p>If you enjoy what you see here and want to get in touch with us, please check out the #mendicant IRC channel on Freenode.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: To a large extent, the original design for this website was based on Peter Cooper&#39;s <a href="http://rubyflow.com">RubyFlow</a>, which is great resource for Ruby programmers. Our focus here is a bit different, but the format is quite similar. Similar to RubyFlow, this web application is free software, and you can <a href="https://github.com/mendicant-university/community">find the source on github</a>.</em></p>
