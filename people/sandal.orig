<div class='description'><p>These days I don&#39;t know whether to call myself a software developer, a teacher, or a writer. I suppose I am all of those things, at varying degrees of experience and quality. What I do know is that my passion lies in teaching others how to use their skills to do amazing things. By founding <a href="http://mendicantuniversity.org">Mendicant University</a>, I am now able to dedicate most of my efforts to helping and teaching others, and that makes me very happy.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/XylbLh.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition to my work on this school, I also run the <a href="http://practicingruby.com">Practicing Ruby Journal</a>. It&#39;s a fairly unique publication that lets me reach a dedicated group of Ruby learners on a weekly basis so that I can share my experiences with them through my writing. This project is also very satisfying to me because the research I put into it helps me become a better teacher, which in turn helps improve Mendicant University over time.</p>
<p>Before founding Mendicant University and beginning work on Practicing Ruby, I had worked on a few of projects you may already be familiar with. My most significant works include the <a href="http://rubybestpractices.com">Ruby Best Practices</a> book published by O&#39;Reilly and the  PDF generation library <a href="http://github.com/sandal/prawn">Prawn</a>. Working on these two projects gave me a great opportunity to interact with really smart folks in the Ruby community, and probably taught me most of what I now know about Ruby and free software development.</p>
<p>These days I spend most of my time teaching, researching, and writing and so I don&#39;t spend as much time working on free software projects as I used to. Over the next few months I will be working on the mail-based microframework <a href="https://github.com/mendicant-university/newman">Newman</a> and also helping <a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn">Prawn</a> reach its 1.0 release, but only in tiny bursts of effort that I can sneak in between the cracks. If I ever I get some real downtime, I would like to continue working on my eBook generation library <a href="http://github.com/sandal/bookie">Bookie</a>, and possibly experiment a bit more with game development. For now, I&#39;ve made helping others with their projects my priority, and while it pains me a bit, i think it&#39;s ultimately more rewarding.</p>
<p>Beyond the technical side of my life, I care a lot about searching for a deeper sense of meaning and purpose in the things we do. I want to make sure that the projects I work on are not just intellectually stimulating, but also directly focused on making life better for people. In the end, I want to cultivate a sense of sustainable pace and living so that the projects I work on can make lasting impacts rather than just ending up as little more than a flash in the pan. These kinds of human problems are just as intensely interesting to me as technical ones, and probably a lot more important, too.</p>
