Learning to Program: How I did it, and why you (probably) should
</div>
<div class='article_content'><p>I&#39;ve been stewing over a blog post for several months, unsure of how to accurately portray my journey so far in learning to program in a way that would help others understand how incredibly life-changing this activity can be.</p>
<p>In addition to &quot;learn, learn, learn&quot;, my goal for the next few years is to drag more of a spotlight over to programming and do my best to make sure people know 1) why programmers are so freakin&#39; special and 2) that anybody can do this.</p>
<p>It&#39;s posted in 3 parts:</p>
<p><a href="http://brandonhays.com/blog/2012/01/23/learning-to-program-part-i-how-i-did-it/">Part 1</a> is just my story, you can skip it if you&#39;d like. It may accidentally contain hidden signposts for others to perhaps follow, but it&#39;s just that: my story.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandonhays.com/blog/2012/01/24/learning-to-program-pt-ii-lessons-that-changed-my-life/">Part 2</a> is like 15 condensed blog posts I&#39;ve been meaning to write with a few of the lessons I&#39;ve picked up in learning to program and just trying to be observant about the culture and attitudes of those I work with.</p>
<p><a href="http://brandonhays.com/blog/2012/01/25/learning-to-program-part-iii-why-you-should-learn-and-why-its-easier-than-you-think/">Part 3</a> is how new people can get started, and why they probably should.</p>
