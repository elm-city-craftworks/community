Introducing Jackpot: SaaS Billing as a Rails Engine
</div>
<div class='article_content'><p>I would like to introduce you my new open source project: <a href="https://github.com/pellegrino/jackpot">Jackpot</a>. It started out here during my core skills project as my and now its going through a major overhaul to get ready to hit its primetime. </p>
<p>Jackpot has pretty high ambitions, though. It aims to become the easiest way to get paid using rails. It abstracts all the nasty details and let you focus on writing your appliaction, not billing code. Billing code is a boring thing to write, so i expect you not having to do it all by yourself, at least not all the time. </p>
<p>I hope you may find that interesting and useful. As always, i look forward for any feedback the community may have. </p>
<p>Check for more details at this <a href="http://vitorpellegrino.com/blog/2012/03/27/jackpot-billing-made-easy-for-rails-apps/">blog post</a></p>
