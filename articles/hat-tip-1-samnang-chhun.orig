Hat Tip #1: Samnang Chhun
</div>
<div class='article_content'><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Coolidge_after_signing_indian_treaty.jpg/160px-Coolidge_after_signing_indian_treaty.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p>
<p>Mendicant University often has so much going on that it&#39;s hard to slow down and say thanks to the folks who are making a huge difference around here. However, I&#39;d like to start doing exactly that by offering periodic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_tip">hat tips</a> to folks who have been doing excellent work for the school and the broader community.</p>
<p>While last month&#39;s push to improve Mendicant University&#39;s infrastructure saw tons of code contributions from over a dozen of our community members, I want to specifically thank <a href="http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/people/samnang">Samnang Chhun</a> for his efforts. It seems that someone forgot to tell Samnang that our focused month of contributing to Mendicant University&#39;s projects has ended, because he just keeps on sending in ideas and patches as fast as we can read them.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot Samnang, you&#39;re making Mendicant University a better place through your efforts. Keep it up!</p>
<p><em>Please feel free to email me suggestions for who should receive the next hat tip in recognition of their contributions to Mendicant University, the Ruby ecosystem, or the world.</em></p>
