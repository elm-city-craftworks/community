W3Clove: beyond charity
</div>
<div class='article_content'><p>Today I talked with Gregory Brown in the #mendicant-alumni IRC channel, to see how the <a href="w3clove-is-now-charity-driven.html">charity-driven model that we started for W3Clove</a> was going and think about the next steps in search of financial sustainability.</p>
<p>The Pledgie campaign has raised $240 in one week, and that&#39;s great as it allows me to cover the expenses I had in the previous months, and is enough for 2 or 3 months more of hosting.</p>
<p>But, donations are hard to maintain. You&#39;ve got to be reminding everyone of the need for donations, and this is tiring for everybody. It&#39;s a good start, but if you want sustainability, you need a supporter network.</p>
<p>So, the next step is building this supporter network. A supporter will be a user that loves the service provided <em>and</em> is conscious that by making use of it, is making the server spend money. So, to keep the service alive, decides to support it with a monthly subscription.</p>
<p>What does the supporter get in return of this monthly fee, apart from feeling well about supporting a great service? <a href="https://gist.github.com/1784822">Check out this gist</a> for the ideas we came up with.</p>
