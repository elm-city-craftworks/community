Why Waterfall was a big misunderstanding from the beginning 
</div>
<div class='article_content'><p>My new <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/why-waterfall-was-a-big-misunderstanding-from-the-beginning-reading-the-original-paper/">blog post</a> deals with the &quot;Waterfall&quot; process model and how the first paper about it already highlighted its weakness. Unfortunately few people know about this, so let&#39;s change that!</p>
<p>You may know the &quot;infamous&quot; Waterfall model, which was supposedly invented back in 1970 in a paper written by Winston Royce and can be seen as some kind of the &quot;arch enemy&quot; of agile methodologies.
The problem is just that this paper didn&#39;t advocate the Waterfall model! It identified the pattern, highlighting its deficiencies and suggesting improvements. These improvements actually contain some agile thoughts, such as &quot;involve the customer&quot;! Winston Royce has been totally misunderstood...</p>
<p>Unfortunately this fact is little known and even PhD lecturers in the field of Software Development Processes seem to be unaware of this fact, at least some of them that I know. That&#39;s why I dedicated <a href="http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2012/03/02/why-waterfall-was-a-big-misunderstanding-from-the-beginning-reading-the-original-paper/">a blog post</a> to this topic. In this blog post I walk the reader through the original paper of Winston Royce. I show the deficiencies of the model, which he identified more than 40 years ago, as well as the improvements he suggests. </p>
<p>And the next time someone wants you to do Waterfall-style development, please tell them that Waterfall was just a big misunderstanding from the beginning ;-)</p>
