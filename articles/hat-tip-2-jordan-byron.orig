Hat Tip #2: Jordan Byron

<div class='article_content'><p><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/48/Coolidge_after_signing_indian_treaty.jpg/160px-Coolidge_after_signing_indian_treaty.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></p>
<p>Mendicant University often has so much going on that it&#39;s hard to slow down and say thanks to the folks who are making a huge difference around here. But because it never hurts to give credit where credit is due, this series of community posts is all about offering periodic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat_tip">hat tips</a> to folks who have been doing excellent work for the school and the broader community.</p>
<p>This time around, my hat goes off to Mendicant University&#39;s co-founder, <a href="http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/people/jordanbyron">Jordan Byron</a>. While his work has benefited us from day one, he has done more work than I have for this community over the last few months. In addition to launching this community website, he also ran our &quot;Mending Mendicant&quot; month in February. Lots of folks contributed great patches to our various projects, but Jordan was the one who had to review and merge all of them.</p>
<p>In March, Jordan ran our third web development course, and helped the students work on building an early prototype for replacing our existing classroom management software . In addition to the course, Jordan also represented Mendicant University in a short lightning talk at MountainWest RubyConf. As if all of that weren&#39;t enough, he also participated in the <a href="http://community.mendicantuniversity.org/articles/2012-ct-mission-of-mercy">5th annual Connecticut Mission of Mercy event</a>, using his technical skills to help real people in pain get the dental treatment they need.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t be more proud to have such an amazingly productive and helpful co-founder, and I can say without hesitation that Mendicant University would not exist without him. If you find time to offer him a few words of thanks, please do so!</p>
<p><em>Please feel free to email me suggestions for who should receive the next hat tip in recognition of their contributions to Mendicant University, the Ruby ecosystem, or the world.</em></p>
